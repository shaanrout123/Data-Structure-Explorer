# Data Structure Visualizer

## Overview

The **Dynamic Data Visualizer** is a Java application designed to provide real-time visualization of various data structures, including stacks, queues, singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and binary trees. Users can interact with the visualizer to perform operations like pushing, popping, enqueuing, and adding nodes, with the results displayed dynamically.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Visualize Stacks, Queues, Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, and Binary Trees.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Perform operations and see immediate updates in the visualizations.
- **Dynamic UI**: Control operations through a unified control panel at the bottom of the main window.
- **Modular Design**: Each data structure visualizer is handled in its own class, allowing for clear and organized code.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
